### **Training Data:**

```javascript
let inputs = [[1], [2], [3], [10], [20], [30]];
let labels = ['low', 'low', 'low', 'high', 'high', 'high'];
```

This tells the AI:

* `[1], [2], [3]` are considered `"low"`
* `[10], [20], [30]` are considered `"high"`

---

### **What the AI Does in `findThreshold()`:**

It calculates:

* `maxSmall = max of low values = 3`
* `minLarge = min of high values = 10`
* Then it finds the midpoint:

  ```javascript
  threshold = (3 + 10) / 2 = 6.5
  ```

---

### **Now Classifying `5`:**

```javascript
if (value < threshold)
{
    return 'low';
}
else
{
    return 'high';
}
```

* Since `5 < 6.5`, it's predicted as `'low'`.

---

The meaning of "low" or "high" is **relative to the training labels and numbers** you gave. The AI isn't using any worldwide knowledge of what "5" means, it's just comparing it to what it learned from the training data.
